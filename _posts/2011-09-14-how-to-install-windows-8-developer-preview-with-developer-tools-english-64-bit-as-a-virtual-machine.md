title: How to Install Windows 8 Developer Preview with developer tools English, 64-bit
  As A Virtual Machine
---

Tonight Windows 8 was released (LEGALLY) at least the Developer Preview edition was! You are able to get your own copy at [http://dev.windows.com/](http://dev.windows.com/). I have an interest in programming but an even greater interest in learning some of the new administrative tools available and things I can dig into a bit more and learn about Windows 8. I decided I was going to install it as a Virtual Machine. When I mounted the ISO it crashes upon startup, so I knew there had to be a setting somewhere I could tweak and it would workâ€¦ I was right. With VirtualBox all you need to do is enable _IO APIC_.

I plan to have a whole guide written on the installation of Windows 8 within the next day.
