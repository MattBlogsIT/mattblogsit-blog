Recently I was asked to be on the **[People Talking Tech Podcast](http://peopletalkingtech.com/)** to talk about my transition from college to my IT career. In the process I was also asked to write a guest blog post on the **[Microsoft Learning Born to Learn blog](http://borntolearn.mslearn.net/)**. It was quite an interesting experiencing having a conversation with someone knowing in the future people would be listening to it. The night of the recording I figured it'd be best to write the blog post so everything was fresh in my mind, I started hammering it out and boom it was done.
