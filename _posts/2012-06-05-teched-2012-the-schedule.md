title: TechEd 2012 â€“ The Schedule
---

If you read my post on [Important Resources](http://mattblogsit.com/2012/05/30/tech-ed-2012-important-resources/) for TechEd you will notice that I mentioned building your schedule, and overbooking yourself for all sessions. After doing such a thing you probably feel like you will be overwhelmed but do not fret. Just take a look at my planned schedule for TechEd!

Some of the events I have on here is specific for me, or are parties that registration may be closed already. Make certain you track down registration for parties because these are the best chances to network and is an extremely useful part of TechEd.
