This is a sample post for the Jekyll-powered GitHub Pages site structure.

The repository has been enhanced with Jekyll automation that:

- **Converts markdown to HTML**: Write content in markdown, Jekyll builds HTML
- **Dynamic navigation**: Automatically discovers pages and posts
- **No complex build processes**: GitHub Pages handles everything
- **Easy to maintain and extend**: Just add markdown files
- **Compatible with GitHub Pages**: Uses built-in Jekyll processing

## How It Works

1. Write content in markdown files
2. Push to GitHub
3. GitHub Pages automatically builds with Jekyll
4. Navigation updates automatically

All previous content has been preserved in the `_backup` directory and can be migrated by converting HTML to markdown files.
