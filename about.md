Matt Griffin is a Systems Architect passionate about technology, volunteering, and adaptive sports.

This site uses Jekyll to dynamically generate HTML from markdown files, making content management much easier while maintaining the dynamic navigation system we built.

## How This Site Works

- **Markdown Content**: All pages and posts are written in markdown
- **Dynamic Navigation**: Jekyll automatically discovers pages and collections
- **GitHub Pages**: Automatically builds and deploys the site
- **Scalable**: Adding new content is as simple as creating new markdown files
