        <p>A couple of weeks ago, I made a post on the study materials I planned on leveraging to learn how to program for the Microsoft HoloLens. This weekend was the first time I finally started digging into studying. I quickly identified that the videos I intended to use might have been a bit off on exactly what I wanted to learn.</p>

<p>To be open and honest with everyone with my adventure, I wanted to share this and point you towards the resources I’ve decided to leverage instead. As I had mentioned in the last post, My Microsoft HoloLens Adventure - Preparing Study Resources. I had looked over some Basics videos back in March when I first started looking into this. I hadn’t touched those since March as I was getting kind of bored with it and it was all I had done when I was in college.</p>

<p>The next section in that post was Universal Apps, which I had never worked with. I started watching the <a href="https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/developing-universal-windows-apps-with-c-and-xaml-8363">Developing Universal Windows Apps with C# and XAML</a> video. I quickly realized that it was going to be too high-level for me since I had such a limited experience. I tried searching for the videos they mention at the beginning of that course but was unable to find them on MVA. However, I was able to find <a href="https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/windows-10-development-for-absolute-beginners-14541">Windows 10 Development for Absolute Beginners</a>. In the first 10 minutes, I was able to figure out how to get my first 2D Application running for HoloLens. Yes, all it was is a button that shows text that says Hello World, but it was an app!</p>
