</ol>

<p>As you can see, we are diving into the how-to part of this blog series, and we will continue diving into OneDrive and SharePoint, focusing on restoring previous and deleted versions of files.</p>

<h1 id="reverting-to-old-versions-of-the-file">Reverting to old versions of the file</h1>

<p>Reverting files can be useful when you work on a file and decide you want to see an older copy. It becomes critical when you are collaborating with a group of people on the same document. Co-authoring is incredibly useful, especially when trying to accomplish work from anywhere on any device. You may not always be in the same physical office as your co-collaborators, and co-authoring office documents gives you the ability to accomplish the same task.</p>

<p>However, co-authoring also introduces additional complications, and you may want to see or restore a previous version of the document. Restoring old versions is entirely possible and easy to do!</p>

<h2 id="through-office-apps">Through Office Apps</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Click <strong>File</strong></li>
  <li>Click <strong>Info</strong></li>
  <li>Click <strong>Version History</strong></li>
  <li>Choose the version you want. You can choose to <strong>Compare</strong> or <strong>Restore</strong> the file after opening it.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="on-the-web">On the Web</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Open your favorite web browser and navigate to <strong><a href="https://www.office.com">https://www.office.com</a></strong> </li>
  <li>Click <strong>Sign in</strong></li>
  <li>Log in using your <strong>Work</strong> account</li>
  <li>Click <strong>OneDrive</strong> or <strong>SharePoint,</strong> depending on where the file is saved.</li>
  <li>Navigate to the file you want to restore</li>
  <li>Select the file you want to see previous versions for</li>
  <li>Click the three dots … icon in the top bar</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Version history</strong></li>
  <li>Select the file version to open it</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="using-the-sync-client">Using the Sync Client</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Navigate to the file you want to restore</li>
  <li>Right-click the file you want to see previous versions for</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Version history</strong></li>
  <li>Choose to <strong>Download</strong> to see a copy of the file, or <strong>Restore</strong> to restore the file.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="recovering-deleted-files">Recovering deleted files</h1>

<p>There are times that you might have deleted a file, or another person with access to the file deleted a file. It doesn’t matter if it is intentional or not; restoring deleted files is possible! To recover deleted files, you will have to use the website to access the recycling bin.</p>

<h2 id="recovering-onedrive-for-business-files">Recovering OneDrive for Business Files</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Open your favorite web browser and navigate to <strong><a href="https://www.office.com">https://www.office.com</a></strong> </li>
  <li>Click <strong>Sign in</strong></li>
  <li>Log in using your <strong>Work</strong> account</li>
  <li>Click <strong>OneDrive</strong></li>
  <li>On the left menu, click <strong>Recycle bin</strong>.</li>
  <li>Select one, or more documents you wish to recover </li>
  <li>Click <strong>Restore</strong> in the top menu</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="recovering-sharepoint-files">Recovering SharePoint Files</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Open your favorite web browser and navigate to <strong><a href="https://www.office.com">https://www.office.com</a></strong> </li>
  <li>Click <strong>Sign in</strong></li>
  <li>Log in using your <strong>Work</strong> account</li>
  <li>Click <strong>SharePoint</strong></li>
  <li>Click the SharePoint Site where the file is saved.</li>
  <li>On the left menu, click <strong>Recycle Bin</strong>.</li>
  <li>Select one, or more documents you wish to recover </li>
  <li>Click <strong>Restore</strong> in the top menu</li>
</ol>

<p>Using OneDrive for Business and SharePoint to save your files gives you many capabilities on how accessible your information is; even old copies of your files are significantly easier to get to without creating multiple copies of the document! I hope you keep reading my blog series on Modern Collaboration and look forward to my next one! I’ll give you a hint. We are going to start exploring Microsoft Teams!</p>
