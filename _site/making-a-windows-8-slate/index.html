        <p>Back when Windows 8 was shown off at the Developers conference someone I work with mentioned it in a meeting, I went into depth about what I knew about it which somehow lead me into being the person spearheading a project of trying to get Apparatus to buy a Slate device we can install Windows 8 on.

<!--more-->
<p>My first task was to figure out what Slates offered the minimum resolution which my results turned up that the Samsung Series 7 Slate was the only one on the market currently. After looking at the price I looked to see what we would miss out on not having the minimum resolution which would be the side-by-side apps using the metro UI. I couldn’t find anything else specifically however there may be more.</p>

<p>I spoke with the CTO and it was decided we get the Samsung Series 7 Slate, next day it was sitting on my desk ready for an Install of Windows 8. So if you don’t have one I suggest you buy one on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005OUQ9WO/ref=as_li_tf_til?tag=mattblogsit-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=B005OUQ9WO&amp;adid=0CMJ493PHYSBXA4G4BDY&amp;">Amazon</a>. If you read on you will see instructions on building your own Windows 8 Slate using a Samsung Series 7 Slate. These instructions will apply to other Slates also. however some steps may very when it comes to booting to install.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1 id="installing-the-os">Installing the OS</h1>

<p>With this being a Slate Device I knew that it would be an OS install from flash drive, so my first step was formatting a flash drive that could store the ISO Files. So I needed a flash drive that could handle storing 4.8 GB of storage for me to install the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/br229516">Windows 8 Developer Preview with developer tools 64-bit</a>. I wasn’t able to locate anymore than 4GB at work so I first installed a 32-bit OS which is only 2.8 GB to play around with. Once I got home I used my 32GB flash drive and re-installed with the Preview with developer tools 64-bit. The instructions on formatting the drive are below.</p>

<h2 id="formatting-the-drive-using-windows-7">Formatting the Drive (Using Windows 7)</h2>

<p>Note: The exact steps are using Windows 7, using other versions of Windows are very similar.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open up an Administrative command prompt
    <ol>
      <li>Click Start</li>
      <li>Type cmd</li>
      <li>Right click cmd.exe</li>
      <li>Click Run as administrator</li>
      <li>Click Yes on the UAC prompt</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Type <em>diskpart</em> in the command prompt</li>
  <li>Type <em>list disk</em></li>
  <li>Once you know which is the Flash drive type <em>select disk__n</em> (select disk 1)</li>
  <li>Type <em>clean</em></li>
  <li>Type <em>create partition primary</em></li>
  <li>Type <em>select partition 1</em></li>
  <li>Type <em>active</em></li>
  <li>Type <em>format quick fs=NTFS</em></li>
  <li>Type <em>assign</em></li>
  <li>Type <em>exit</em></li>
  <li>This part is easy, you will need to mount the ISO using your program of choice, I use Virtual Clone Drive by <a href="http://www.slysoft.com/en/virtual-clonedrive.html">SlySoft</a></li>
  <li>Next you will open the folder in Windows Explorer</li>
  <li>You will also open your empty flash drive with Windows Explorer</li>
  <li>Then copy all files off the ISO to the flash drive</li>
</ol>

<p>You have now made a Bootable USB device with Windows 8 installation on it.</p>

<h1 id="booting-the-usb-and-installing-windows-8"> Booting the USB and Installing Windows 8</h1>

<p>Before installing Windows 8 make sure you update the BIOS with the Windows 7 installation it comes with. I am not going to have you boot into the BIOS just the boot selection screen.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Boot the system by holding the Windows button and pressing the Power button, hold it while powering on if you want in the BIOS.
    <ol>
      <li>[caption id=”attachment_64” align=”aligncenter” width=”600”]<a href="http://mattblogsit.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0538.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/posts/IMG_0538.jpg" alt="" title="IMG_0538" /></a> Samsung Series 7 Slate Boot Selection[/caption]</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>If you just tapped the buttons to power it on a Boot selection screen will appear</li>
  <li>Select your USB flash drive</li>
  <li>Use volume up/down to move, and the screen lock button to select</li>
  <li>Once the USB installer loads you can use the touch interface.</li>
  <li>Click Next</li>
  <li>Click Install now</li>
  <li>Read the license terms, and check I accept the license terms</li>
  <li>Click Next</li>
  <li>Click Custom (advanced)</li>
  <li>Click Drive Options</li>
  <li>Delete all volumes</li>
  <li>Click New</li>
  <li>Click Ok</li>
  <li>Click Next</li>
</ol>

<p>You will be guided through the rest of the Installation and Setup by Windows, congratulations you have created a Windows 8 Slate using the Samsung Series 7 Slate.</p>
