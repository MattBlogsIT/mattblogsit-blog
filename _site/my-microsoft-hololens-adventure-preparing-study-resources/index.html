<h1 id="basics">Basics:</h1>

<p>To do this I actually started digging in a bit back in March covering some of the basics to refresh my memory. One of my favorite resources is the <a href="https://mva.microsoft.com">Microsoft Virtual Academy</a>. I haven’t watched much but the first video I started watching was <a href="https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/c-fundamentals-for-absolute-beginners-16169">Bob Tabor’s C# Fundamentals for Absolute Beginners</a>. As the subject says this is for absolute beginners so I’ve done a bit of skimming on a lot of the videos, but it gives a good introduction if you haven’t programmed before. I most likely will continue to skim these videos occasionally just to keep my mind fresh since I haven’t written a full blow application before.</p>

<h1 id="universal-apps">Universal Apps:</h1>

<p>The next video series I intend to watch is the <a href="https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/developing-universal-windows-apps-with-c-and-xaml-8363">Developing Universal Windows Apps with C# and XAML</a>. The reason I am wanting to check with video out is my applications I want to have work across all Windows Platforms - this is something I’ve never done so it’ll be a challenge to pick it up. The nice thing about using this as a stepping stone is Universal Apps will not only work on HoloLens but also Windows 8+ Windows PC’s and Windows Phones.</p>

<h1 id="hololens-apps">HoloLens Apps:</h1>

<p>When developing for the HoloLens there are two different types of app models, let’s explore each one.</p>

<h2 id="2d-apps">2D Apps:</h2>

<p>2D HoloLens apps will be the easiest ones to build - at least I think it will be for me. These apps are just like any other Windows Universal App, except the HoloLens will project the 2D App on a wall, or in front of you while using the HoloLens.</p>

<p>To make 2D Apps on the HoloLens I am intending to heavily rely on the <a href="https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/developing-universal-windows-apps-with-c-and-xaml-8363">Developing Uniersal Windows Apps with C# and XAML</a> that is referenced under Universal Apps section.</p>

<p>In addition to the video the Microsoft Dev Center also has a couple of pages on building 2D Apps.</p>

<p><a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/holographic/building_2d_apps">Building 2D apps</a> <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/holographic/current_limitations_for_apps_using_apis_from_the_shell">Current limitations for apps using APIs from the shell</a></p>

<h2 id="holographic-apps">Holographic Apps:</h2>

<p>Holographic Apps are a very new concept - this is what makes the HoloLens a truly magical experience. You will see 3D renderings throughout your house, office, or where ever you are using the HoloLens at.</p>

<p>To start developing for HoloLens you must understand the different ways to interact with the HoloLens. This includes</p>

<p>World coordinates Gaze input Gesture input Voice input Spatial sound Spatial mapping</p>

<p>To get a better understanding of the ways you interact with the HoloLens I suggest taking a look at the Development Overview video from Microsoft.</p>

<p>As I continue my adventure with learning how to develop for HoloLens I’ll make sure I share more information as I find it.</p>
