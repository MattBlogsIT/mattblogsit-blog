    <div class="page-content">
        <p>I’ve been asked this question directly by more than one person, simply because I have friends who didn’t understand why I am still staying extremely socially distant. Why would they know? They are back in the office and doing ‘business as usual.’ I’ve even had some tongue-in-cheek remarks about traveling the world since I am not going into the office.</p>

<p>I finally figured out how to describe why I take COVID-19 so seriously, and I wanted to share it with everyone.</p>

<p>Let’s take a common cold, for example. If a perfectly healthy person gets a cold, they are out sick for a day or two. For me, it is 3-4 days.</p>

<p>Let’s take it up a level, last time I had the flu, can you guess how long I was out of commission? I’d say that a week is a pretty bad case of the flu for a perfectly healthy person. The last time I had it, I was bed-ridden for a week and hardly moved around the house for another five days. My total recovery time, almost two weeks!</p>

<p>Now the reason my recovery is extended when I am sick is due to having Muscular Dystrophy. I know the spectrum of symptoms people get from COVID-19 is vast, from an annoying cough to life-threatening. However, considering I have pre-existing conditions that could significantly complicate those symptoms.</p>

<p>I choose to protect myself and try to reduce the spread of COVID-19, and I would ask anyone who knows me or anyone with a pre-existing condition to do the same. Wear a mask, socially distance, and the most honorable thing? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Vg_9jDuX8">Stay the f**k at home (uncensored video in link)</a>.</p>
