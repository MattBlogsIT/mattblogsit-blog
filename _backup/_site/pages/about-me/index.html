        <p>Matt Griffin graduated in May 2012 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Information Technology from the Purdue School of Engineering and Technology. Currently, he is the Systems Architect at Gaylor Electric. He owns his own IT Consulting and Managed Services firm, The IT Fellas. Matt is passionate about volunteering. He serves on the Purdue School of Engineering and Technology Alumni Association Board of Directors at IUPUI since 2014. In January of 2019, Matt joined the Board of Directors for a non-profit organization named the Muscular Dystrophy Family Foundation (MDFF). The MDFF focuses on increasing the quality of life and independence of people with Muscular Dystrophy and their family through advocacy, education, and financial resources. Outside of work and volunteering, Matt enjoys participating in Adaptive Sports. Currently, he is playing for the Wheelchair Lacrosse team Indy RIP based in Indianapolis, IN.</p>

<h2 id="work">Work</h2>

<p>Matt started his professional career in 2008, working at IUPUI for two separate departments while also working on his Bachelor’s Degree. He re-designed and managed the Computer Information Technology Department’s website in the Purdue School of Engineering &amp; Technology. Additionally, Matt worked as a Support Technician for University College Technology Services at IUPUI. Throughout Matt’s college career, he worked for a variety of departments. Before graduating, he started at Apparatus, a local IT Managed Services and Consulting firm.</p>

<p>Upon leaving Apparatus in 2015, Matt joined Gaylor Electric as the Systems Architect responsible for rebuilding all IT Systems at the company and preparing the organization to grow from 185 million to 300 million. During this time, the entire Datacenter and Network of the organization have been rebuilt from the ground up. The IT department is now focused on driving value to the company, not just being a cost center. The company is well on track to reach 300 million in Annual Revenue.</p>

<p>Matt has always had a competitive spirit. He played soccer at a young age, basketball for a bit in Elementary School, and then stopped competing when his disability made it too tough to continue.</p>

<p>Around the age of 16, Matt started playing <a href="https://www.powersoccerusa.org/">Power Soccer</a> on a local team called RHI Indy Storm. He played Power Soccer for Indy Storm for a few years before being recruited to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ccrpowersoccer/">Circle City Rollers</a> for the 2009 season. At the end of the 2009 season, he tried out for Power Soccer Team USA for the 2011 World Cup. He was accepted to the team and attended the Training Camps through 2011 before needing to drop out due to work and school taking priority over Power Soccer. He continued playing Power Soccer until the end of the 2012 season with Circle City Rollers. </p>

<p>During the 2018 RHI Adaptive Sports Expo, Matt discovered the sport of Wheelchair Lacrosse. Never having had an interest in Lacrosse, he still thought it’d be fun to try out. Matt thought it’d be worth trying out after getting used to holding a stick, throwing the ball (terribly), and moving around with the stick. During the 2019 season for RHI Indy RIP, he joined the team. To date, he has attended one tournament where they placed 3rd.</p>

<h2 id="travels">Travels</h2>

<p>Matt loves traveling and has been very fortunate through work, adaptive sports, and life, in general, to have been able to travel to many places. The below map outlines cities he’s stayed in at a minimum overnight, usually multiple nights.</p>
