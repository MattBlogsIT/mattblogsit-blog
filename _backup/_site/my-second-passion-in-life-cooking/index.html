        <p>Now I know this is an IT focused blog, but it is also my personal blog and I feel like cooking is big chunk of what I enjoy doing in my free time. Recently I’ve crafted a couple of my own recipes that I feel I’d like to share with everyone.

The two I would like to share today include Matt’s Christmas Balls and Matt’s Bacon-Wrapped Jalapeño Poppers.</p>

<p>Lets start with my favorite and newest recipe!</p>

<h1 id="matts-bacon-wrapped-jalapeño-poppers">Matt’s Bacon-Wrapped Jalapeño Poppers</h1>

<p>[caption id=”attachment_149” align=”aligncenter” width=”620”]<img src="/assets/images/posts/WP_20121231_002-1-1024x515.jpg" alt="Matt's Bacon-Wrapped Jalapeño Poppers" /> Matt’s Bacon-Wrapped Jalapeño Poppers[/caption]</p>

<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
  <li>(8) 2-3” Jalapeño’s</li>
  <li>(1) bottle of Red Bone Alley Pineapple Ginger Teriyaki</li>
  <li>(4) tablespoons of fresh chopped chives</li>
  <li>(1) 8 oz. Philadelphia Cream Cheese - Softened</li>
  <li>(1) 12 oz. package of center cut bacon</li>
  <li>(16) Toothpicks</li>
  <li>(2) plastic non-powered gloves</li>

<h2 id="directions"> Directions</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Warning: Wear gloves while handling jalapeño’s</li>
  <li>Wash outside of jalapeño’s</li>
  <li>Cut stem and slice jalapeño’s in half</li>
  <li>Cut out the seed and membrane from the jalapeño’s</li>
  <li>Be sure to wash all of the seeds off of the jalapeño’s</li>
  <li>Place in plastic bag and let marinate with the entire bottle of Red Bone Alley Pineapple Ginger Teriyaki, place in refrigerator.
    <ol>
      <li>Note: How long you let it marinate is at your discretion, overnight would be ideal I just did an hour on my first attempt.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Place softened cream cheese and 4 tablespoons of fresh chopped chives in small mixing bowl, mix until it looks like it is consistent throughout.</li>
  <li>Preheat oven to 375</li>
  <li>Warning: This gets messy</li>
  <li>Fill the marinated jalapeño’s with the cream cheese and chives mix, wrap with an entire slice of bacon, top with a little bit of the teriyaki sauce and place on baking pan
    <ol>
      <li>Note: I used stone ware for my cooking so depending on your tray baking times will vary.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Once all jalapeños are completed use remaining teriyaki sauce and top all of the poppers</li>
  <li>Bake for 25 minutes</li>
  <li>Insert toothpicks into each popper and consume while warm!</li>
</ol>
