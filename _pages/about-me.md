Matt Griffin graduated in May 2012 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Information Technology from the Purdue School of Engineering and Technology. Currently, he is the Principal Advisor, Cloud Technical Services at Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc. Outside of work, Matt focuses primarily on his family—his lovely wife and amazing daughter. He enjoys participating in Adaptive Sports and currently plays for the Wheelchair Lacrosse team Indy RIP based in Indianapolis, IN.

## Work

Matt started his professional career in 2008, working at IUPUI for two separate departments while also working on his Bachelor's Degree. He re-designed and managed the Computer Information Technology Department's website in the Purdue School of Engineering & Technology. Additionally, Matt worked as a Support Technician for University College Technology Services at IUPUI. Throughout Matt's college career, he worked for a variety of departments. Before graduating, he started at Apparatus, a local IT Managed Services and Consulting firm.

Upon leaving Apparatus in 2015, Matt joined Gaylor Electric as the Systems Architect responsible for rebuilding all IT Systems and preparing the organization to scale from $185 million to $300 million. During this time, the entire datacenter and network were rebuilt from the ground up, and the IT department shifted focus from being a cost center to driving value for the company. Matt revolutionized the onboarding process by consolidating four disconnected technology systems into two fully integrated platforms, improving consistency and accuracy for every new employee. He also developed PowerShell modules to automate account creation and termination, reducing helpdesk turnaround on these tasks by 10x.

After Gaylor Electric, Matt joined Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc. (MISO Energy) as a Principal Analyst, Cloud. Over the years he has progressed to his current role as Principal Advisor, Cloud Technical Services. He drives innovation for cloud adoption at scale, focusing on reliability and compliance to meet strict regulatory requirements in the energy sector. Matt develops reusable Terraform modules for Azure, AI Services, OpenAI Services, and Machine Learning workspaces, and collaborates with the Data Architecture team on cloud-native scaling strategies. He also works closely with Cyber Security and Information Risk teams to ensure Microsoft Cloud technologies are monitored and secured across the organization.

## Athletics

Matt has always had a competitive spirit. He played soccer at a young age, basketball for a bit in Elementary School, and then stopped competing when his disability made it too tough to continue.

### Power Soccer

Around the age of 16, Matt started playing Power Soccer on a local team called RHI Indy Storm. He played Power Soccer for Indianapolis for several years and made it to the Team USA Power Soccer training camps through 2011. After RHI Indy Storm disolved, Matt joined Circle City Rollers and played with them until  2012.
