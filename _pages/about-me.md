## Work

Matt started his professional career in 2008, working at IUPUI for two separate departments while also working on his Bachelor's Degree. He re-designed and managed the Computer Information Technology Department's website in the Purdue School of Engineering & Technology. Additionally, Matt worked as a Support Technician for University College Technology Services at IUPUI. Throughout Matt's college career, he worked for a variety of departments. Before graduating, he started at Apparatus, a local IT Managed Services and Consulting firm.

Upon leaving Apparatus in 2015, Matt joined Gaylor Electric as the Systems Architect responsible for rebuilding all IT Systems at the company and preparing the organization to grow from 185 million to 300 million. During this time, the entire Datacenter and Network of the organization have been rebuilt from the ground up. The IT department is now focused on driving value to the company, not just being a cost center. The company is well on track to reach 300 million in Annual Revenue.

## Athletics

Matt has always had a competitive spirit. He played soccer at a young age, basketball for a bit in Elementary School, and then stopped competing when his disability made it too tough to continue.

### Power Soccer

Around the age of 16, Matt started playing Power Soccer on a local team called RHI Indy Storm. He played Power Soccer for Indianapolis for several years and made it to the Team USA Power Soccer training camps through 2011. After the local team stopped playing, Matt joined Circle City Rollers and played with them until the team stopped functioning in 2012.
